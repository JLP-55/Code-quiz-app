# JavaScript Coding Quiz App

## Description

With the aim of implementing all the knowledge aquired over the previous four weeks of my coding bootcamp, I was set the task of creating a web application using Javascript, CSS and HTML to quiz my knowledge of Javascript. 

Although the question are simple enough, the real learning value has come from building, debugging, and then further refining my code in order to more deeply understand just how Javascript runs within the web browser.

## Usage

Click "Start Quiz" to begin the quiz. Answer all questions and then follow the prompts to either log your scores or return back to the beginning without saving them.
